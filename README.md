# Library
The Library project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).

## Sumary
I have used [Bulma](http://bulma.io) to make the site layout and forms, it's really simple to use and looks neat. Also used localStorage, so the library remembers user's books (only device wise).
